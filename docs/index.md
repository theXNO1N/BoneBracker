<h3 align="left">What is password cracker ?</h3>
<p align="left">Password cracking refers to various measures used to discover computer passwords. This is usually accomplished by recovering passwords from data stored in, or transported from, a computer system. Password cracking is done by either repeatedly guessing the password, usually through a computer algorithm in which the computer tries numerous combinations until the password is successfully discovered. Hackers use password cracking in order to gain unauthorized access to a computer without the computer owner’s awareness.</p>

<h3 align="left">What is Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) ?</h3>
<p align="left">An ARP spoofing, also known as ARP poisoning, is a Man in the Middle (MitM) attack that allows attackers to intercept communication between two parties either to secretly eavesdrop or modify traffic traveling between the two. Attackers might use MitM attacks to steal login credentials or personal information, spy on the victim, or sabotage communications or corrupt data. The attack works as follows:</p>
<p align="left">    1 - The attacker try to gain access to the network, then scan the network to find the IP addresses of his victims. For example the IP address of PC and router</p>
<p align="left">    2 - The attacker uses any spoofing tool (such as arpspoof) to send out forged ARP responses.</p>
<p align="left">    3 - The forged responses trick the PC by sending the attacker’s MAC address as the router’s MAC address, and trick the router by sending the attacker’s MAC address as the PC’s MAC address. This fools both router and PC to connect to the attacker’s machine, instead of to each other.</p>
<p align="left">    4 - The two devices update their ARP cache entries. After that, the communication is going through the attacker machine instead of directly with each other.</p>
<p align="left">    5 - The attacker is now secretly in the middle of all communications.</p>

<h3 align="left">What is a vulnerability scanning ?</h3>
<p align="left">Vulnerability scanning is an automated process that allows the organizations to check if their networks, systems and applications have security vulnerabilities that could expose them to attacks. Vulnerability scanning is performed by the IT department of the organization or a third-party security service provider. This scan is also performed by the attackers who try to discover entry points into the target network.</p>
<h1 align="center">port scanner</h1>

<h3 align="left">What is port scanning ?</h3>
<p align="left">Briefly, Port Scanning is a technique helps the attackers to determine which ports on a network are open and discover services they can exploit to break into a computer system.</p>
